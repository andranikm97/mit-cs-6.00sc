# Description

The repo contains scripts that I wrote to aid my learning in following along MIT 6.00SC Comp Sci course led by the brilliant Prof. John Guttag.

## Hangman.py

It's a simple game of Hangman, with ~60K words to choose from. Pretty fun!

## Scrabble.py

You play scrabble against a computer. The compute always wins, as it goes through all permutations of given letters and finds the best word possible :/

## Roomba.py

A nice simulation of floor cleaning robots in a room of a rectangular shape. The simulation not only gives out the average amount of time a group robots need to surpass a predefined minimum coverage of the room, but also an animation that displays robot movement.
